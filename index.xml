      <description>I have just recently improved my terminal setup after learning how to use Tmux. It gave me a way to move faster between projects and even kept my session saved after machine shutdowns. My goal here is to help you configure a environment that will be both beautiful and functional. Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it.

      <description>Hi! üëã My name is Andr√© Brand√£o and I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer at Favo.
I have a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Computer Engineering from UNICAMP (Brazil) and have worked with tech companies for over 5 years. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been particularly interested in high-quality software, test-driven development and application performance.
I also developed an entrepreneurial mindset through life experimentation. Some of these experiences were exchange programs, living in a fraternity, being a partner in two companies and living one year in a sustainable ecovillage.</description>
